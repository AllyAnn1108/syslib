# Markdown notes Week 5: Wordpress

Wordpress is a more **complex** platform but allows us to add more style to our website and allows us to focus on how the site looks.

Something to note is the amount of modules that needed to be installed:
- php-curl
- php-xml
- php-imagick
- php-mbstring
- php-zip
- php-intl
