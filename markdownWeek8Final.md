# Markdown Notes Week 8: Combining Wordpress, Koha and Omeka

To my surprise, combining these three modules was not as hard as I expected.

However, I still run into a port issue on my Koha install.

**Port 80** still does not load the standard website, and only **Port 8080** works.

Other than that, I really enjoyed adding a theme to my wordpress site.
